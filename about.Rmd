## My Trajectory
***

After obtaining a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Economics from Brown University, and after working as a research assistant for three years in the Real Estate Finance section of the Federal Reserve Board, I earned my M.A. in Economics at the University of Rochester. I went on to work for the New York City Mayor's Office of Management and Budget for two years, where I served as a senior analyst in the Policy and Operations Research Task Force evaluating initiatives aimed at supporting people experiencing homelessness in the city. Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, I transitioned to researching transmission dynamics in the city, which would compel me to pursue a career in public health. To that end, I am currently pursuing an M.S. in Biostatistics at the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health.
